I found the hardest part of  this submission was writing the function.
I initially used pseudo code to map out the problem and then proceeded to make
a table of inputs, outputs and mark ups.
I also struggled a bit with following through with the
order of operations while writing my function.
I used a loop that hooked on to an if statement based on the product
that was inputed which returned the value that customers had to pay.
I really enjoy solving puzzles like this because it allows me to challenge
myself in a way that I've never had to before in previous roles.
